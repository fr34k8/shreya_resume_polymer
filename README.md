# \<shreya_resume\>

A resume created for my friend, who is a fashion stylist. This application uses a [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database and storage to store the text and images that are displayed and is designed using [Google's Polymer Framework](https://www.polymer-project.org/).
This application/web page is served [here](https://shreyaganesh-788d8.firebaseapp.com/) using the firebase hosting service.

## Dependencies
Since I have used the polymer framework, this application needs [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and bower(https://bower.io/)
You can install npm along with [node](https://nodejs.org/) from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. This should also install bower as dependency. Then run `polymer serve` to serve the application locally.
```
$ npm install -g polymer-cli
```

## Viewing this Application
